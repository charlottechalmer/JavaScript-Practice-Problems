	//MY THOUGH PROCESS NOTES:
	//need to write a function that will search and find the best profit betwteen two values
	//this means that are looking for the LARGEST POSSIBLE DIFFERENCE between two values
	//NOTE: because indexes are minutes, can only sell at prices listed AFTER index at which bought
	//can be done interatively:
		//take one index, iterate through, store the largest difference between each
		//do this for each index overwriting the stored value if it is larger than that stored
		//return largest profit

	//what im thinking:
		//look for smallest number (Math.min) listed
		//look only within following indexes for the largest number listed
			//problem with this:
				//smallest number might be the last listed or too close to end to be valuable
				//a greater profit might be elsewhere

		//okay so maybe look for a max first and then look through preceding indexes for min
			//problems:
				//max might be first

		//next thought:
		//scan for max-- can this become the cutoff point?
			//NO-- i.e. [9, 8, 12, 2, 4, 7, 10]
		//Recursive function base case finding:
			// given the dummy data: stockPricesYesterday = [10, 7, 5, 8, 11, 9]
			// take 10
				//7 - 10 = -3
				//5 - 10 = -5
				//8 - 10 = -2
				//11 - 10 = 1 **This is the highest profit if bought at stockPricesYesterday[0]
				//9 - 10 = -1
			//take 7
				//5 - 7 = -2
				//8 - 7 = 1
				//11 - 7 = 4

			//so I am noticing that you would only need to find the difference btw the value at a given index and any following value greater than that value because those are the only profits rather than losses

//FIRST PASS ATTEMPT -- WOULD TAKE O(n)^2 TIME
		// function getMaxProfit(arr) {
		// 	var maxProfit = 0;
		// 	if (arr.length < 2) {
		// 		console.log("You need at least two values to get a profit");

		// 	}
		// 	for (var i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
		// 		for(var j = 0; j < i; j++) {
		// 			var potentialProfit = arr[i] - arr[j];
		// 			if (potentialProfit > maxProfit) {
		// 				maxProfit = potentialProfit;
		// 			}
		// 		}
		// 	}
		// 	return maxProfit;
		// }

//SECOND PASS ATTEMPT -- try to make so only passes once, store the min price

	// 			minPrice = arr[i];
	// 		}
	// 		var potentialProfit = arr[i] - minPrice;
	// 		if (potentialProfit > maxProfit) {
	// 			maxProfit = potentialProfit;
	// 		}
	// 	}
	// 	return maxProfit;
	// }
//CLEANED UP & EDGE CASES CONSIDERED
	function getMaxProfit(arr) {
		var minPrice = arr[0];
		var maxProfit = arr[1] - arr[0];

			console.log("You need at least two values to get a profit");
			return;
		}
		for (var i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) { //START AT 1 SO NEVER BUYING & SELLING AT SAME TIME
			var currentPrice = arr[i];
			var potentialProfit = currentPrice - minPrice;
			maxProfit = Math.max(potentialProfit, maxProfit);
			minPrice = Math.min(minPrice, currentPrice); //HAVE TO PUT THIS AFTER MAXPROFIT TO ENSURE ALWAYS BUYING AT AN EARLIER PRICE, NEVER THE CURRENT PRICE*********

// run your function through some test cases here
// remember: debugging is half the battle!

	// var stockPricesYesterday = [1000, 1];

	// var stockPricesYesterday = [100];
		//0

//THEIR FIRST ANSWER W/NOTES:
/*
  function getMaxProfit(stockPricesYesterday) {

    var maxProfit = 0;

    // go through every time
    for (var outerTime = 0; outerTime < stockPricesYesterday.length; outerTime++) {

        // for every time, got through every OTHER time
        for (var innerTime = 0; innerTime < stockPricesYesterday.length; innerTime++) {

            // for each pair, find the earlier and later times
            var earlierTime = Math.min(outerTime, innerTime);
            var laterTime   = Math.max(outerTime, innerTime);

            // and use those to find the earlier and later prices
            var earlierPrice = stockPricesYesterday[earlierTime];
            var laterPrice   = stockPricesYesterday[laterTime];

            // see what our profit would be if we bought at the
            // min price and sold at the current price
            var potentialProfit = laterPrice - earlierPrice;

            // update maxProfit if we can do better
            maxProfit = Math.max(maxProfit, potentialProfit);
        }
    }

    return maxProfit;
}

But that will take O(n^2) time, since we have two nested loops—for every time, we're going through every other time. Also, it's not correct: we won't ever report a negative profit! Can we do better?

Well, we’re doing a lot of extra work. We’re looking at every pair twice. We know we have to buy before we sell, so in our inner for loop we could just look at every price after the price in our outer for loop.

That could look like this:

//THEIR SECOND ANSWER:
unction getMaxProfit(stockPricesYesterday) {

    var maxProfit = 0;

    // go through every price and time
    for (var earlierTime = 0; earlierTime < stockPricesYesterday.length; earlierTime++) {
        var earlierPrice = stockPricesYesterday[earlierTime];

        // and go through all the LATER prices
        for (var laterTime = earlierTime + 1; laterTime < stockPricesYesterday.length; laterTime++) {
            var laterPrice = stockPricesYesterday[laterTime];

            // see what our profit would be if we bought at the
            // min price and sold at the current price
            var potentialProfit = laterPrice - earlierPrice;

            // update maxProfit if we can do better
            maxProfit = Math.max(maxProfit, potentialProfit);
        }
    }

    return maxProfit;
}
Well, our outer for loop goes through all the times and prices, but our inner for loop goes through one fewer price each time. So our total number of steps is the sum n + (n - 1) + (n - 2) ... + 2 + 1n+(n−1)+(n−2)...+2+1 which is still O(n^2)

If we're going to do better than O(n^2), we're probably going to do it in either O(n lg n) or O(n). O(n lg n) comes up in sorting and searching algorithms where we're recursively cutting the set in half. It's not obvious that we can save time by cutting the set in half here. Let's first see how well we can do by looping through the set only once.

Since we're trying to loop through the set once, let's use a greedy approach, where we keep a running maxProfit until we reach the end. We'll start our maxProfit at $0. As we're iterating, how do we know if we've found a new maxProfit?

At each iteration, our maxProfit is either:

the same as the maxProfit at the last time step, or
the max profit we can get by selling at the currentPrice
How do we know when we have case (2)?

The max profit we can get by selling at the currentPrice is simply the difference between the currentPrice and the minPrice from earlier in the day. If this difference is greater than the current maxProfit, we have a new maxProfit.

So for every price, we’ll need to:

keep track of the lowest price we’ve seen so far
see if we can get a better profit

  function getMaxProfit(stockPricesYesterday) {

    var minPrice = stockPricesYesterday[0];
    var maxProfit = 0;

    for (var i = 0; i < stockPricesYesterday.length; i++) {
        var currentPrice = stockPricesYesterday[i];

        // ensure min_price is the lowest price we've seen so far
        minPrice = Math.min(minPrice, currentPrice);

        // see what our profit would be if we bought at the
        // min price and sold at the current price
        var potentialProfit = currentPrice - minPrice;

        // update maxProfit if we can do better
        maxProfit = Math.max(maxProfit, potentialProfit);
    }

    return maxProfit;
}

We’re finding the max profit with one pass and constant space!

Are we done? Let’s think about some edge cases. What if the stock value stays the same? What if the stock value goes down all day?

If the stock price doesn't change, the max possible profit is 0. Our function will correctly return that. So we're good.

But if the value goes down all day, we’re in trouble. Our function would return 0, but there’s no way we could break even if the price always goes down.

How can we handle this?

Well, what are our options? Leaving our function as it is and just returning zero is not a reasonable option—we wouldn't know if our best profit was negative or actually zero, so we'd be losing information. Two reasonable options could be:

return a negative profit. “What’s the least badly we could have done?”
throw an exception. “We should not have purchased stocks yesterday!”
In this case, it’s probably best to go with option (1). The advantages of returning a negative profit are:

	We more accurately answer the challenge. If profit is "revenue minus expenses", we’re returning the best we could have done.
	It's less opinionated. We'll leave decisions up to our function’s users. It would be easy to wrap our function in a helper function to decide if it’s worth making a purchase.
	We allow ourselves to collect better data. It matters if we would have lost money, and it matters how much we would have lost. If we’re trying to get rich, we’ll probably care about those numbers.
How can we adjust our function to return a negative profit if we can only lose money? Initializing maxProfit to 0 won’t work...

Well, we started our minPrice at the first price, so let’s start our maxProfit at the first profit we could get—if we buy at the first time and sell at the second time.
	minPrice = stockPricesYesterday[0];
	maxProfit = stockPricesYesterday[1] - stockPricesYesterday[0];

But we have the potential for reading undefined values here, if stockPricesYesterday has fewer than 2 prices.

We do want to throw an exception in that case, since profit requires buying and selling, which we can't do with less than 2 prices. So, let's explicitly check for this case and handle it:

  if (stockPricesYesterday.length < 2) {
    throw new Error('Getting a profit requires at least 2 prices');
	}

	var minPrice = stockPricesYesterday[0];
	var maxProfit = stockPricesYesterday[1] - stockPricesYesterday[0];

Ok, does that work?

No! maxProfit is still always 0! What’s happening?

If the price always goes down, minPrice is always set to the currentPrice. So currentPrice - minPrice comes out to 0, which of course will always be greater than a negative profit.

When we’re calculating the maxProfit, we need to make sure we never have a case where we try both buying and selling stocks at the currentPrice.

To make sure we’re always buying at an earlier price, never the currentPrice, let’s switch the order around so we calculate maxProfit before we update minPrice.

We'll also need to pay special attention to time 0. Make sure we don't try to buy and sell at time 0!

SOLUTION:
We’ll greedily ↴ walk through the array to track the max profit and lowest price so far.

For every price, we check if:
	-we can get a better profit by buying at minPrice and selling at the currentPrice
	-we have a new minPrice

To start, we initialize:
	-minPrice as the first price of the day
	-maxProfit as the first profit we could get

We decided to return a negative profit if the price decreases all day and we can't make any money. We could have thrown an exception instead, but returning the negative profit is cleaner, makes our function less opinionated, and ensures we don't lose information.

  function getMaxProfit(stockPricesYesterday) {

    // make sure we have at least 2 prices
    if (stockPricesYesterday.length < 2) {
        throw new Error('Getting a profit requires at least 2 prices');
    }

    // we'll greedily update minPrice and maxProfit, so we initialize
    // them to the first price and the first possible profit
    var minPrice = stockPricesYesterday[0];
    var maxProfit = stockPricesYesterday[1] - stockPricesYesterday[0];

    // start at the second (index 1) time
    // we can't sell at the first time, since we must buy first,
    // and we can't buy and sell at the same time!
    // if we started at index 0, we'd try to buy /and/ sell at time 0.
    // this would give a profit of 0, which is a problem if our
    // maxProfit is supposed to be /negative/--we'd return 0!
    for (var i = 1; i < stockPricesYesterday.length; i++) {
        var currentPrice = stockPricesYesterday[i];

        // see what our profit would be if we bought at the
        // min price and sold at the current price
        var potentialProfit = currentPrice - minPrice;

        // update maxProfit if we can do better
        maxProfit = Math.max(maxProfit, potentialProfit);

        // update minPrice so it's always
        // the lowest price we've seen so far
        minPrice = Math.min(minPrice, currentPrice);
    }

    return maxProfit;
}
