		/*write a function to find the recrangular intersection of two given love triangles
		- rectangles are always "straight" and never "diagonal" --> each side is parallel with either the x-axis or the y-axis
		-defined as objects like this:
			var myRectangle1 = {

				// coordinates of bottom-left corner
				leftX: 1,
				bottomY: 5,

				//width and height
				width: 10,
				height: 4,
			};

		THINGS TO CONSIDER:
			What if there is no overlap?
			What if one rectangle is completely enveloped in the other?
			What if they dont overlap, but rather share an edge? ***
