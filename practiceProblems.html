		Bean counting problem:
			"You can get the Nth character, or letter, from a string by writing "string".charAt(n), similar to how you get its length with "string".length. The returned value will be a string containing only one character (for example, "b"). The first character has position zero, which causes the last one to be found at position string.length - 1. In other words, a two-character string has a length 2, and its characters have positions 0 and 1.
			
			"Write a function countBs that takes a string as its only argument and returns a number that indicates how many upper case "B" characcters are in the string.

			"Next, write a function called countChar that behaves like countBs, except it takes a second argument that indicates the character that is to be counted (rather than counting only uppercase "B" characters). Rewrite countBs to make use of this function."

		function countBs(string) {
			var count = 0;
			for (var i = 0; i < string.length; i++) {
				if (string.charAt(i) === "B") {
					count += 1;
				} 
			}
			return count;
		}

		function countChar(string, char) {
			var count = 0;
			for (var i = 0; i < string.length; i++) {
				if (string.charAt(i) === char) {
					count +=1;
				}
			}
			return count;
		}

		console.log(countBs("BBC"));
// → 2
console.log(countChar("kakkerlak", "k"));
// → 4
