		- zero is even.
		- one is odd.
		- for any other number, n, its evenness is the same as n - 2.
	Define a recursive function isEven corresponding to this description. The function should accept a number parameter and return a Boolean.
	Test it on 50 and 75. See how it behaves on -1. Why? Can you think of a way to fix this?"

		Bean counting problem:
			"You can get the Nth character, or letter, from a string by writing "string".charAt(n), similar to how you get its length with "string".length. The returned value will be a string containing only one character (for example, "b"). The first character has position zero, which causes the last one to be found at position string.length - 1. In other words, a two-character string has a length 2, and its characters have positions 0 and 1.
			
			"Write a function countBs that takes a string as its only argument and returns a number that indicates how many upper case "B" characcters are in the string.

			"Next, write a function called countChar that behaves like countBs, except it takes a second argument that indicates the character that is to be counted (rather than counting only uppercase "B" characters). Rewrite countBs to make use of this function."
